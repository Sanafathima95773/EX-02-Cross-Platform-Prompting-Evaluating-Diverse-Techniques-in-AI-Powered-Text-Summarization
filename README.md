# EX-02-Cross-Platform-Prompting-Evaluating-Diverse-Techniques-in-AI-Powered-Text-Summarization

## AIM
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

## Scenario:

### Step 1:

Summarize the following 500-word article on “The Basics of Blockchain Technology” in 120–150 words for undergraduate students. Keep it clear and beginner-friendly.


Blockchain is a digital system that records transactions securely and transparently without needing a central authority like a bank. It is made of blocks of data linked in a chain, where each block contains information and is protected by cryptography. Once data is added, it cannot be altered, making blockchain highly secure and trustworthy. This decentralized network ensures all participants have the same copy of information, reducing fraud and errors. While it was first developed for Bitcoin, blockchain is now used in many fields. Its benefits include security, transparency, and efficiency, though challenges like high energy use and scalability remain. Overall, blockchain is a foundation for new digital innovations and helps people exchange information or value in a reliable way.


### Step 2 (Feedback):

Please revise the summary to make it even simpler and include at least two real-world examples of blockchain applications.

Blockchain is like a digital notebook shared by many people, where everyone can see the same information, but no one can secretly change it. It stores data in blocks connected in a chain, making it secure and transparent. This system removes the need for middlemen, like banks, and helps people trust each other online. For example, Bitcoin uses blockchain to transfer money safely without banks. Another example is supply chain tracking, where companies use blockchain to check if products like medicines or food are genuine. While blockchain is powerful, it still faces issues like high energy use and slow transactions. Still, it is an important technology shaping the future of finance, trade, and record-keeping.

## Algorithm

1. Input a 500-word article on blockchain.

2. Apply different prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) to request summarization across AI platforms.

3. Collect the generated summaries.

4. Compare the clarity, accuracy, and beginner-friendliness of each summary.

5. Revise based on feedback to simplify further and add real-world examples.

6. Document results (Step 1 and Step 2 outputs).

## Result

● Step 1 produced a structured beginner-level summary of blockchain 

● Step 2 improved accessibility by simplifying language and adding real-world examples (Bitcoin, supply chain).

● The experiment shows how prompt refinement (feedback/role-based prompting) enhances clarity and usefulness for undergraduates.
